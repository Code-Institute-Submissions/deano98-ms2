# Milestone Project 2 - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

This website is a simple game based on the slightly more complex version of Rock Paper Scissors, created by Sam Kass and which famously featured on The Big Bang Theory TV show. 

"Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitate lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporises rock and as it always has, rock crushes scissors" - *Sheldon Cooper*

The game will be a nod to the show and will appeal to fans, as well as everyone else. It will operate as per the rules above and the user will be up against the computer in a best of 1, 3 or 5 games. The aim is to provide the user with a simple bit of interactive fun.
